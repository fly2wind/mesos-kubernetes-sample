# To avoid seeks ZooKeeper allocates space in the transaction log file in
# blocks of preAllocSize kilobytes. The default block size is 64M. One reason
# for changing the size of the blocks is to reduce the block size if snapshots
# are taken more often. (Also, see snapCount).
#preAllocSize=65536

# Clients can submit requests faster than ZooKeeper can process them,
# especially if there are a lot of clients. To prevent ZooKeeper from running
# out of memory due to queued requests, ZooKeeper will throttle clients so that
# there is no more than globalOutstandingLimit outstanding requests in the
# system. The default limit is 1,000.ZooKeeper logs transactions to a
# transaction log. After snapCount transactions are written to a log file a
# snapshot is started and a new transaction log file is started. The default
# snapCount is 10,000.
#snapCount=1000

# If this option is defined, requests will be will logged to a trace file named
# traceFile.year.month.day.

# Leader accepts client connections. Default value is "yes". The leader machine
